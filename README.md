# led-transit-sign

Micro Project to create a realtime lcd display that has arrival
times for the most frequently used transit stop I have at my apartment.

I'll be using Python, Flask, and my Raspberry Pi.


to start the application

# create an env
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# export FLASK_APP=lcd-transit-sign.py
# run flask
